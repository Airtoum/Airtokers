# Airtokers

This is my Balatro mod! Featuring some silly and some mathy effects. Requires [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) and [Steammodded/SMODS](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods), and should be compatible with [Talisman](https://github.com/SpectralPack/Talisman) and [Cryptid](https://github.com/SpectralPack/Cryptid). (I've worked really hard to make it as compatible with Talisman as I can.) For installation instructions, install Lovely then SMODS. They have pretty good instructions for installing them on their pages. To install Airtokers, clone this repo and place it in the Mods folder within `.../Balatro/Mods/`. On Windows this is in the %AppData% folder.

SuperCrash.wav is something I made a long time ago using a bunch of sound effects from the Youtube Audio Library. Here is all of the sound effects used in that sound:

(none of these are attributed to a single person in the listing of Youtube Audio Library. If they were I would name them as well)

elevator_cable1.ogg and elevator_cable2.ogg were recorded by me! I made them by sampling a zipper on my hoodie.

ploop1.ogg, ploop2.ogg, ploop3.ogg, ploop4.ogg, and ploop5.ogg were also recorded by me. I made it by dropping a d20 into a very large cup. I also put a paper towel at the bottom of the cup for some of them to dampen the rattle of the dice hitting the bottom.

The idea for the elevator making a water drop sound when facing the water was from Hyperspade

The name "Euler's Curse" is from ItsPhoenix

Some of the math algorithms weren't derived by me. I've left references to them in the code.
